This is my python implementation of the Lowest Common Ancestor Binary Tree problem.
Python is a language I am not familiar with but luckily I have found a simple solution to
issue.

I've gone back and pushed up my work again to see that I am still able to push sucessfully.
.
I have two Github profiles so it seems that for me to choose between each one I need to access control panel and delete
the github permission each time I wish to switch accounts

Added Unit Testing in Python.
I followed this tutorial here on Unit Testing in Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0soBPejyu4

Heres the steps to what I did:
1. Created a new directory in my project folder called "tests"
2. Then we right click -> new -> test file -> then called it lowestCommonAncestorTest.py
3. Then we add the line "import unittest" as this is python's unit testing library
4. There are then plenty of rules that need to be followed when creating a test case.

In order to get the tests working in VSCode, the editor I used for these testings, I had to enable testing by following this 
tutorial here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing
