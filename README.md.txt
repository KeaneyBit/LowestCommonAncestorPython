This is my python implementation of the Lowest Common Ancestor Binary Tree problem.
Python is a language I am not familiar with but luckily I have found a simple solution to
issue.

I've gone back and pushed up my work again to see that I am still able to push sucessfully.
.
I have two Github profiles so it seems that for me to choose between each one I need to access control panel and delete
the github permission each time I wish to switch accounts

Added Unit Testing in Python.
I followed this tutorial here on Unit Testing in Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0soBPejyu4

Heres the steps to what I did:
1. Created a new directory in my project folder called "tests"
2. Then we right click -> new -> test file -> then called it lowestCommonAncestorTest.py
3. Then we add the line "import unittest" as this is python's unit testing library
